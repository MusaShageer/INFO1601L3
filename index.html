        <h2>Rita and the Rifle</h2>
        <p>Between Rita and my eyes, there is a rifle.</p>

        <p>And whoever knows Rita, kneels and prays<br>
        To the divinity in those honey-colored eyes.<br>
        And I kissed Rita when she was young.<br>
        And I remember how she approached<br>
        And how my arm covered the loveliest of braids.</p>

        <p>And I remember Rita,<br>
        The way a sparrow remembers its stream.<br>
        Ah, Rita!<br>
        Between us are a million sparrows and images<br>
        And many appointments<br>
        Fired at by a rifle.</p>

        <p>Rita's name was a feast in my mouth,<br>
        Rita's body was a wedding in my blood.<br>
        And I was lost in Rita for two years,<br>
        And for two years she slept on my arm<br>
        And we made promises<br>
        Over the most beautiful of cups.<br>
        And we burned in the wine of our lips<br>
        And we were born again.</p>

        <p>Ah, Rita!<br>
        Did anything avert my eyes from your eyes<br>
        Except for two short naps<br>
        And honey-colored clouds?<br>
        Before this rifle,<br>
        "It was, it was not."</p>

        <p>O quiet of the evening,<br>
        My moon has emigrated far in the morning<br>
        To the honey-colored eyes.<br>
        The city has swept away all the singers,<br>
        And Rita.</p>

        <p>Between Rita and my eyes, there is a rifle.</p>
